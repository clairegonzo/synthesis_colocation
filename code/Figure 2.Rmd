### Reading in Data

Data contains 'orphans'. 

```{r}
mydata <- read_csv(here("data", "Data_total_working_for_r.csv"))
  
```

## Wrangling

First step will be to create a subset of the columns that are required

```{r}
data_sub <- mydata %>% 
  select(first_author, year, aquaculture_present, wind_present, wave_present, tidal_present, other_present)
```
