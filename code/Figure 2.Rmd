Figure 2 is a stacked bar plot that show which ocean activities are co-located with eachother from all the publicaitons.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE
)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)


```


### Reading in Data

Data contains 'orphans'. 

```{r}
mydata <- read_csv(here("data", "Data_total_working_for_r.csv"))
  
```

## Wrangling

First step will be to create a subset of the columns that are required

```{r}
data_sub <- mydata %>% 
  select(id, aquaculture_present, wind_present, wave_present, tidal_present, other_present)
```

Trying to break it up into ocean activities and then creating a co-occurrence matrix within each ocean activity
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# start with aquaculture

aq <- data_sub %>% 
  filter(aquaculture_present == "1") %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% # I think changing this will help (maybe to wind present etc??) ugh idk
  summarize(
    mutate(wind = sum(wind_present))
  )

```
